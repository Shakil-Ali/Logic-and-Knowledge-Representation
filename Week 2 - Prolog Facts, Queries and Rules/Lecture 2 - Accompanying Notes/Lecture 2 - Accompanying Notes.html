<h1>In the Last Lecture</h1>

<p>In the last lecture we saw that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The semantics (meaning) of a propositional formula is defined in terms of its <i>truth table</i>. Each row in the truth table corresponds to an <i>interpretation</i>. An interpretation gives a value of 'true' or 'false' to each of the propositions in the logic's <i>signature</i> (vocabulary of propositions).<br><br></li>

<li>An interpretation <i>satisfies</i> a formula if it assigns a value of 'true' to the formula, in which case the interpretation is a <i>model</i> of the formula. A formula is <i>satisfiable</i> if it has at least one model. Otherwise it is <i>unsatisfiable</i>.<br><br></li>

<li>The formula A <i>entails</i> the formula B if every model of A is also a model of B.<br><br></li>

<li>An <i>inference rule</i> is a rule for generating a new formula (called the <i>conclusion</i>) from a list of existing formulas (called the <i>premises</i>). A set of inference rules is called a <i>calculus</i>, and a series of applications of the inference rules is called a <i>derivation</i>.<br><br></li>

<!--
<li>A calculus is <i>sound</i> if, for any set of formulas KB and formula F,
if F is derivable from KB then F is entailed by KB. The calculus is <i>complete</i> if, for any set of formulas KB and formula F, if F is entailed by KB then F is derivable from KB.<br><br></li>

<li>The <i>resolution calculus</i> allows formulas to be derived from a knowledge base in <i>conjunctive normal form</i> (CNF) using the principle of <i>proof by contradiction</i>.</li>

<h1>Prolog Facts</h1>

<ul>
    <li><i>Facts</i> in Prolog state that certain propositions are true or that certain relationships hold between certain objects.<br><br></li> 

    <li>For example, the fact
    <pre>&nbsp;
it_is_raining.</pre>
    states that the proposition 'it_is_raining' is true, and the fact
    <pre>&nbsp;
likes(john, big_mac).</pre>
    states that the relation 'likes' holds between the objects 'john' and 'big_mac'.<br><br></li> 

    <li>In Prolog and in logic programming in general, we generally call propositions and relationships such as those above <i>predicates</i>, while the objects such as 'john' and 'big_mac' above are called <i>arguments</i>. The <i>arity</i> of a predicate is the number of arguments it takes, so 'it_is_raining' has arity 0 whereas 'likes' has arity 2.<br><br></li> 
</ul>

</div>

<h1>An Example Program of Facts</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Suppose we have the following Prolog program (which is really just a list or database of facts):

<pre>&nbsp;
likes(john, big_mac).     /* comments in Prolog programs are    */
likes(mary, big_mac).     /* written between backslash and star */
likes(mary, ice_cream).   /* symbols like this.                 */
likes(sue, apple_pie).
likes(sue, ice_cream).    % Single-line comments can also start  
likes(chris, milkshake).  % with a percentage sign.</pre>

We regard this set of facts as the <i>definition</i> for the predicate 'likes' - more properly the definition of the predicate 'likes/2', the '/2' indicating the number of arguments 'likes' requires (i.e. the arity of the predicate).<br><br></li> 

    <li>If the program above is saved in a file called 'foodPreferences.pl' (a plain text file), we can load it into SWI Prolog with this <i>consult</i> command (assuming it is in the default or current SWI Prolog directory):
    
<pre>&nbsp;
?- [foodPreferences].</pre>

or equivalently by using the SWI Prolog '<i>file - consult ...</i>' menu option.
    </li> 
</ul>

<h1>Prolog Queries</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Having defined a predicate (e.g. 'likes/2'), we can use this definition to find out whether the predicate is true or false for certain values of its arguments by making a <i>query</i>.<br><br></li> 

    <li>Thus if we ask (in SWI Prolog)

<pre>&nbsp;
?- likes(sue, ice_cream).</pre>

Prolog will answer 'true' (or 'yes' in some systems), since the fact

<pre>&nbsp;
likes(sue, ice_cream).</pre>

is in the program. ('?-' is a notation commonly adopted in Prolog systems to indicate that a query is being asked.)<br><br></li> 

    <li>If we ask

<pre>&nbsp;
?- likes(john, ice_cream).</pre>

then Prolog will answer 'false' (or 'no' in some systems).<br><br></li>

    <li>Queries are also known as goals. Thus the first query above represents the goal 'likes(sue, ice_cream)'.</li> 
 
</ul>

<h1>Queries With Variables</h1>

<ul>
    <li>We can also introduce variables into both facts and queries. Variables are used to stand for an unspecified single object. In SWI Prolog, variable names begin with an upper-case letter or the underscore character _.<br><br></li> 

    <li>The following query means 'is there an X such that likes(chris, X) is true?':

<pre>&nbsp;
?- likes(chris, X).</pre></li> 
 
    <li>Since 'likes(chris, milkshake)' appears in the program, the answer is 'true', together with the <i>substitution</i> {X=milkshake}.<br><br></li>
    
    <li>When more than one substitution makes a query true, we can view these one-by-one in SWI Prolog by typing ';'. For example:

<pre>&nbsp;
?- likes(sue, X).</pre></li> 
 
    <li>Note that we can also ask queries such as:

<pre>&nbsp;
?- likes(X, big_mac).
?- likes(X,Y).</pre></li>


</ul>

<h1>Conjunctions of Queries</h1>

<ul>
    <li>We can also extend our queries from those expressing a single goal to those expressing a conjunction of goals (i.e. an "and" of two or more goals).<br><br></li> 

    <li>An "and" in Prolog is indicated with a comma. For example, the query

<pre>&nbsp;
?- likes(john, X), likes(mary, X).</pre>

is asking for an X such that both john and mary like X.<br><br></li> 
 
    <li>In this case SWI Prolog first outputs

<pre>&nbsp;
X = big_mac</pre>

and then, if we type ';' for an alternative substitution, outputs

<pre>&nbsp;
false</pre>

because the program does not list anything else that both john and mary like.</li>

<h1>A Family Program</h1>

father(geoffrey, katherine).

<h1>Prolog Rules</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Prolog <i>rules</i> provide a means of defining relationships in terms of other relationships. One of the rules in 'mothersAndFathers.pl' is

<pre>&nbsp;
grandfather(X,Z) :- father(X,Y), father(Y,Z).</pre></li> 

    <li>The ':-' is read as an 'if', so that the above rule can be interpreted as<br><br>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>'X is the grandfather of Z if X is the father of Y and Y is the father of Z'</i><br><br></li>
    
    <li>In general, rules have the form

<pre>&nbsp;
A :- B<sub>1</sub>, ....., B<sub>n</sub>.</pre>

'<tt>A</tt>' is known as the <i>head</i> of the rule, the conjunction '<tt>B<sub>1</sub>, ....., B<sub>n</sub></tt>' is known as the <i>body</i>.<br><br></li>

    <li>As another example, the formula on Slide 4 of Lecture 1 can be represented in Prolog as the rule

<pre>&nbsp;
i_am_wet :- it_is_raining, i_am_outside.</pre></li> 

<li>The definition of a predicate may be a mixture of facts and rules:

<pre>&nbsp;
male(X) :- 
    father(X, Y).
male(oscar).
.....
</pre></li>

 
</ul>
